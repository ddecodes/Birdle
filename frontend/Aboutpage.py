        "To predict voices or identify different speakers using spectrograms and a Support Vector Classifier (SVC), "
        "we first convert audio signals into spectrograms. Spectrograms are visual representations that illustrate how "
        "the frequency content of the audio varies over time. This process involves generating spectrograms from the audio "
        "and then extracting numerical features from these visualizations. Commonly used features include Mel-Frequency "
        "Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), which capture the timbral texture of the audio, along with additional features "
        "such as chroma features and spectral contrast."

        "Once we have extracted these features, we proceed to train an SVC model. The training phase utilizes a dataset "
        "in which each audio sample is represented by its features and labeled according to the specific speaker or voice "
        "characteristic. The SVC model learns to classify these features into different categories based on the provided labels."

        "After training the model, we can use it to predict new voices. For this purpose, we extract the same features from "
        "a new audio sample and input these features into the trained SVC model. The model then predicts the class, such as "
        "the speakerâ€™s identity, based on the input features. This approach integrates the detailed frequency analysis offered "
        "by spectrograms with the powerful classification capabilities of SVC, enabling us to effectively identify and predict different voices."
